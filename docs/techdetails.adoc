== Compatibility

Copper requires to be used with a {cpp} compiler that supports at least the {cpp}17 standard.
If supported, Copper also accesses some features of {cpp}20. These are tested by `\__cpp_concepts >= 201907L` and `__cpp_lib_erase_if >= 202002L`.

Copper and its unit tests were successfully compiled and run on the following systems:

* Mac OS X 10.15.7, AppleClang 12.0.0.12000032
* Ubuntu 20.04.2, GCC 9.3.0
* Arch Linux 5.11.16, GCC 10.2.0
* Arch Linux 5.11.16, Clang 11.1.0


== Type Requirements

A type non-void `T` needs to satisfy the following requirements to be sent via a `copper::channel`:

* default constructible
* move constructible
* move assignable
* destructible

If your compiler supports C++20 concepts, these properties are checked when instantiating the template.

== Memory Space

On a typical 64 bit system, types of Copper can be expected to have the following sizes in memory:

|===
|type |size in bytes

| `copper::buffered_channel<T>` for `T â‰  void`
| 296 + buffer size * `sizeof(T)`

| `copper::buffered_channel<void>`
| 224

| `copper::unbuffered_channel<T>`
| 208

| `copper::channel_push_iterator<copper::buffered_channel<T>>`
| 16

| `copper::channel_pop_iterator<copper::buffered_channel<T>>`
| 24

| `copper::channel_read_view<copper::buffered_channel<T>>`
| 8

| `copper::channel_write_view<copper::buffered_channel<T>>`
| 8
|===

In addition, all channels take up about 40 bytes additional storage for each pending operation that is executed on them.

== Operation Cost

For a **buffered** channel `chan` that contains element of a non-void type `T`, the following calls occur for different operations:

|===
|operation |calls to `T()` |`T(const T&)` |`T(T&&)` |`T::operator=(T&&)`

|`chan.push(x)` (lvalue ref)
|0
|1
|1
|0

|`chan.push(std::move(x))`
|0
|0
|2
|0

|`chan.push_func([&x] {return std::move(x);})`
|0
|0
|2
|0

|`chan.pop()`
|1-2*
|0
|1-2*
|1

|`chan.pop_func([](T&&) {})`
|0-1*
|0
|1-2*
|0
|===
[*] If a pop operation is called while a buffered channel is full and even more push operations are already pending, the pop operation will move the next pending push to the internal buffer, causing one additional call to `T()` and `T(T&&)` each.


For an **unbuffered** channel `chan` that contains element of a non-void type `T`, the following calls occur for different operations:

|===
|operation |calls to `T()` |`T(const T&)` |`T(T&&)` |`T::operator=(T&&)`

|`chan.push(x)` (lvalue ref)
|0
|1
|0
|0

|`chan.push(std::move(x))`
|0
|0
|1
|0

|`chan.push_func([&x] {return std::move(x);})`
|0
|0
|1
|0

|`chan.pop()`
|1
|0
|1
|1

|`chan.pop_func([](T&&) {})`
|0
|0
|0
|0

(In some specific cases, a buffered channel might be able to skip using its buffer and reach the same performance of unbuffered channels.)


== Benchmark (SPSC)

(Disclaimer: The following measurements were done on a single 6-core CPU by a simple "measure multiple times and take the average" strategy. They can vary greatly depending on the CPU architecture, the surrounding memory model, and the thread scheduler.)

In this benchmark, data is being sent from one thread to another via three different methods:

1. `std::queue` with a `std::mutex` and a `std::condition_variable`
2. `copper::buffered_channel`
3. `copper::unbuffered_channel`

Also, a program which mimics the behavior as closely as possible was written in Go using native channel objects.

Two types of messages are compared:

1. `int`, as an fast-to-move message
2. `std::array<int, 10'000>`, as a large, slow-to-move message type

The table below displays the average time to send and receive one message and the resulting data rate.

== Benchmark (MPSC)

(Disclaimer: The following measurements were done on a single 6-core CPU by a simple "measure multiple times and take the average" strategy. They can vary greatly depending on the CPU architecture, the surrounding memory model, and the thread scheduler.)

In this benchmark, two types of data are sent from two separate producer threads to a single consumer thread. For that, four different methods are used:

1. `std::queue<std::variant>` with a `std::mutex` and a `std::condition_variable`
2. Two `std::queue` with `std::mutex` and polling
3. `copper::buffered_channel` and `copper::select`
4. `copper::unbuffered_channel` and `copper::select`

Also, a program which mimics the behavior as closely as possible was written in Go using native channel objects.

In the first case, the two types of data are `int` and `float`. In the second case, the types are `std::array<int, 10'000>` and `std::array<float, 10'000>`.

The table below displays the average time to send and receive one message and the resulting data rate.
Note that the messages are not processed further, which means that any overhead from dealing with `std::variant` is not part of the measurement.
